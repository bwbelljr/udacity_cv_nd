    "## Step 1: Explore the Data Loader\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already written a [data loader](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/data.html#torch.utils.data.DataLoader) that you can use to load the COCO dataset in batches. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the code cell below, you will initialize the data loader by using the `get_loader` function in **data_loader.py**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> For this project, you are not permitted to change the **data_loader.py** file, which must be used as-is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `get_loader` function takes as input a number of arguments that can be explored in **data_loader.py**.  Take the time to explore these arguments now by opening **data_loader.py** in a new window.  Most of the arguments must be left at their default values, and you are only allowed to amend the values of the arguments below:\n",
    "1. **`transform`** - an [image transform](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/transforms.html) specifying how to pre-process the images and convert them to PyTorch tensors before using them as input to the CNN encoder.  For now, you are encouraged to keep the transform as provided in `transform_train`.  You will have the opportunity later to choose your own image transform to pre-process the COCO images.\n",
    "2. **`mode`** - one of `'train'` (loads the training data in batches) or `'test'` (for the test data). We will say that the data loader is in training or test mode, respectively.  While following the instructions in this notebook, please keep the data loader in training mode by setting `mode='train'`.\n",
    "3. **`batch_size`** - determines the batch size.  When training the model, this is number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step.\n",
    "4. **`vocab_threshold`** - the total number of times that a word must appear in the in the training captions before it is used as part of the vocabulary.  Words that have fewer than `vocab_threshold` occurrences in the training captions are considered unknown words. \n",
    "5. **`vocab_from_file`** - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will describe the `vocab_threshold` and `vocab_from_file` arguments in more detail soon.  For now, run the code cell below.  Be patient - it may take a couple of minutes to run!"

    "The `__getitem__` method in the `CoCoDataset` class determines how an image-caption pair is pre-processed before being incorporated into a batch.  This is true for all `Dataset` classes in PyTorch; if this is unfamiliar to you, please review [the tutorial linked above](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/data_loading_tutorial.html). \n",

    "When the data loader is in training mode, this method begins by first obtaining the filename (`path`) of a training image and its corresponding caption (`caption`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Image Pre-Processing \n",
    "\n",
    "Image pre-processing is relatively straightforward (from the `__getitem__` method in the `CoCoDataset` class):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Convert image to tensor and pre-process using transform\n",
    "image = Image.open(os.path.join(self.img_folder, path)).convert('RGB')\n",
    "image = self.transform(image)\n",
    "```\n",
    "After loading the image in the training folder with name `path`, the image is pre-processed using the same transform (`transform_train`) that was supplied when instantiating the data loader.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Caption Pre-Processing \n",
    "\n",
    "The captions also need to be pre-processed and prepped for training. In this example, for generating captions, we are aiming to create a model that predicts the next token of a sentence from previous tokens, so we turn the caption associated with any image into a list of tokenized words, before casting it to a PyTorch tensor that we can use to train the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand in more detail how COCO captions are pre-processed, we'll first need to take a look at the `vocab` instance variable of the `CoCoDataset` class.  The code snippet below is pulled from the `__init__` method of the `CoCoDataset` class:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def __init__(self, transform, mode, batch_size, vocab_threshold, vocab_file, start_word, \n",
    "        end_word, unk_word, annotations_file, vocab_from_file, img_folder):\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        self.vocab = Vocabulary(vocab_threshold, vocab_file, start_word,\n",
    "            end_word, unk_word, annotations_file, vocab_from_file)\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "From the code snippet above, you can see that `data_loader.dataset.vocab` is an instance of the `Vocabulary` class from **vocabulary.py**.  Take the time now to verify this for yourself by looking at the full code in **data_loader.py**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We use this instance to pre-process the COCO captions (from the `__getitem__` method in the `CoCoDataset` class):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Convert caption to tensor of word ids.\n",
    "tokens = nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize(str(caption).lower())   # line 1\n",
    "caption = []                                                 # line 2\n",
    "caption.append(self.vocab(self.vocab.start_word))            # line 3\n",

    "caption = torch.Tensor(caption).long()                       # line 6\n",
    "```\n",
