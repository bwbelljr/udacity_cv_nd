# Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree Projects

Below are descriptions of the three projects completed in Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree.

## Project 1: Facial Keypoint Detection

In this project, you’ll combine your knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. Your completed code should be able to look at any image, detect faces, and predict the locations of facial keypoints on each face.

## Project 2: Image Captioning

In this project, you will create a neural network architecture to automatically generate captions from images. After using the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset to train your network, you will test your network on novel images!

## Project 3: Landmark Detection & Robot Tracking (SLAM)

In this project, you'll implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world! You’ll combine what you know about robot sensor measurements and movement to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time. SLAM gives you a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features. This is an active area of research in the fields of robotics and autonomous systems.
